Capstone project (Lake Washington I.T.)

## Documentation
Capston project in my senior year at LW Tech. 
This project involved researching market demands and developing a web application to meet those demands.

This web app visualizes users' Bible reading progress through charts. Bonus features include providing a random Bible verse upon successful login and utilizing a REST API to display sections or the entire Bible.

Tools: 
React.JS, HTML, CSS, Chart.js, AWS RDS(MySql), AWS Lambda, API Gateway

//self-commnet:
I need more sophisticated and precise calculations for the charts. Currently, the data and method for determining reading progress are solely based on the total number of Bible verses.
